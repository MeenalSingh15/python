```python
print("hello")
```



```python
def hello_world():
    print("Hello, World!")
```

Python supports several built-in data types that are commonly used in programming. Here are some of the main data types in Python:

Numeric Types:

int: Integer data type (e.g., 42, -10).
float: Floating-point data type (e.g., 3.14, -0.5).
Sequence Types:

str: String data type (e.g., "Hello, World!").
list: List data type (ordered and mutable sequence).
tuple: Tuple data type (ordered and immutable sequence).
Mapping Type:

dict: Dictionary data type (unordered collection of key-value pairs).
Set Types:

set: Set data type (unordered collection of unique elements).
frozenset: Immutable set.
Boolean Type:

bool: Boolean data type (either True or False).
None Type:

None: Represents the absence of a value or a null value.
These data types provide flexibility for storing and manipulating different kinds of data in Python. You can use type-specific functions and operators to perform operations on these data types. Additionally, Python is dynamically typed, meaning you don't need to explicitly declare the data type of a variable; it is inferred at runtime.

Examples:
```python
# Numeric types
integer_var = 42
float_var = 3.14

# Sequence types
string_var = "Hello, World!"
list_var = [1, 2, 3]
tuple_var = (4, 5, 6)

# Mapping type
dict_var = {'name': 'John', 'age': 25}

# Set type
set_var = {1, 2, 3}

# Boolean type
bool_var = True

# None type
none_var = None
```
