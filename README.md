```python
print("hello")
```



```python
def hello_world():
    print("Hello, World!")
```

Python supports several built-in data types that are commonly used in programming. 
The main data types in Python:

# \*Numeric Types:\*
*int: Integer data type i.e number is positive or negative but never a fraction or decimal. 
(e.g., 36, -36).
*float: Floating-point data type is a data type that includes real number that are both whole numbers or fractions .
(e.g., 3.14, -0.5).

# **\*\*Sequence Types:\*\***
* str: String data type
Strings are basically any sequences of characters, which can include letters,symbols,numbers and whitespaces.In pyhton and most programming languages, strings are enclosed in quotation marks (either single ' or double "). 
For example:
"Hello, world!"
'This is a string.'
"12345"
'Special characters: !@#$%^&*()'

* list: List data type (ordered and mutable sequence).
* tuple: Tuple data type (ordered and immutable sequence).
* Mapping Type:
   *dict: Dictionary data type (unordered collection of key-value pairs).


* Set Types:
   *set: Set data type (unordered collection of unique elements).
   *frozenset: Immutable set.

*Boolean Type:
  *bool: Boolean data type (either True or False).
*None Type:
  *None: Represents the absence of a value or a null value.
   These data types give python flexibility to work on so many types of data and manipulate so many types of data.
   You can use type-specific functions and operators i.e functions and operators designed for a specific type of data  to perform operations on these data types. 
   Python is dynamically typed, meaning you don't need to explicitly declare the data type of a variable it is inferred at runtime.

Examples:
```python
# Numeric types
integer_var = 42
float_var = 3.14

# Sequence types
string_var = "Hello, World!"
list_var = [1, 2, 3]
tuple_var = (4, 5, 6)

# Mapping type
dict_var = {'name': 'John', 'age': 25}

# Set type
set_var = {1, 2, 3}

# Boolean type
bool_var = True

# None type
none_var = None
```
